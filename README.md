# Sybrand's [NixOS] configuration
I share most of my configuration across both of my hosts (a laptop and a desktop) but they do have host-specific configuraton in the [`hosts`](https://github.com/syberant/nix-config/tree/master/hosts) folder.

In this config I take advantage of the following projects:
- [Nix] and [NixOS] obviously
- [home-manager], fantastic for managing the dotfiles in your home directory, also contains many helpful modules
- [nixos-hardware], a surprisingly hard to find gem that contains hardware-specific configurations for many laptops
- [Nix User Repository (NUR)][NUR], provides an easy way to share unofficial packages
- [nix-neovim], my own toy project for configuring Neovim with Nix
